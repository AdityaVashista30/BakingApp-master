## Project Overview
An app to view video recipes. It will handle media loading, verify user interfaces with UI tests, and integrate third party libraries. It will also provide a complete user experience with a home screen widget. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget.


### General App Usage
-    App should display recipes from provided network resource.
-    App should allow navigation between individual recipes and recipe steps.
-    App uses RecyclerView and can handle recipe steps that include videos or images.
-    App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.

### Components and Libraries
-    Application uses Master Detail Flow to display recipe steps and navigation between them.
-    Application uses Exoplayer to display videos.
-    Application properly initializes and releases video assets when appropriate.
-    Application should properly retrieve media assets from the provided network links. It should properly handle network requests.
-    Application makes use of Espresso to test aspects of the UI.
-    Application sensibly utilizes a third-party library to enhance the app's features. That could be helper library to interface with Content Providers if you choose to store the recipes, a UI binding library to avoid writing findViewById a bunch of times, or something similar.
